        <p>2020 has been a year full of surprises and hurdles. From abruptly transitioning to working from home,
          playing toilet paper scavenger hunt, and everyone having to learn that the mask needs to cover your nose as well,
          its been tough. We hope you still like the people you live with...
        </p>
        <p>Relieve some of that stress with your very own green companion that will always listen but never get you stuck
          in a meeting that could&#39;ve been an email, judge you for still being in pajamas, or make fun of you for the quarantine
          haircut you decided on giving yourself.
